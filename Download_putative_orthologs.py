# The purpose of this program is to scrape information off of GenomeAlliance.com
# and put the information (of a gene: genomicDNA code, the coding sequence (excluding introns), and the protein code).
# into a tab-delimited file.

# Organization of file:   Transcript_ID   |    CDS   |    protein seq   |    genomicDNA seq

# Input: unix shell script (.sh) of transcript id
